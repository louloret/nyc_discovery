    "description": "Hello, r/nycmeetups.   \n  \n20M here from California traveling to NYC later this month. I'm going to be hosting a meetup in Central Park at The Great Lawn to play a game of catch. Preferably, I'd like to play catch with a baseball, so if possible please bring your glove with you. But it isn't limited to just baseball. If anyone has a football that works too. And for anyone who doesn't have a glove, I will also bring tennis balls as an alternative.\n\nI'm not familiar with the area at all, so I'm just going off of Maps right now. I'll probably be between Softball Fields #3 and #5. If any locals viewing the post who are interested in attending but have a better location to meet at within Central Park, please let me know!\n\nFeel free to message me. I'm also down to grab food in the area before/after depending on what everybody's schedules are looking like. \n\n  \nThank you! I look forward to meeting you all!",

I\u2019ve been obsessively listening to them for the last couple of months, and they\u2019re one of my favorite bands at the moment.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s already going or has a group that\u2019s cool with adding a +1, I\u2019d love to tag along. Or if you\u2019re also solo and thinking of going, maybe we can start a group!\n\nI'm thinking of heading to the venue early; would be down to meet up and grab food or drinks around 5:30 PM if that sounds good with anyone else.\n\nAbout me: I'm into alt/emo/y2k fashion, raves, analog/scifi horror, indie games, and I\u2019ve been getting back into reading lately. Looking to make some new friends who are into similar things.\n\nLet me know if you're going or want to plan something!",
